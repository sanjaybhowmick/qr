1. Complete solution for a form that generates a vCard QR code based on user input:

### Key Improvements:

1. Updated QR Code Library: Now using qrcode.js from CDNJS which is actively maintained
2. Higher Resolution Download: The download button now creates a 4x resolution version of the QR code (1024x1024 pixels) for better quality when printed.
3. Better Error Handling: Added checks to prevent download attempts before QR code generation.
4. Debugging Option: Added a hidden div that shows the generated vCard content (can be useful for debugging).
5. Fixed jQuery URL: Corrected the jQuery CDN URL (removed duplicate colon).

This solution provides a reliable way to generate vCard QR codes with all the fields you requested, with proper validation for required fields, and high-quality QR code generation and download.

The QR codes generated will be scannable by any smartphone's camera or QR code reader app, and will add the contact information directly to the user's address book.
